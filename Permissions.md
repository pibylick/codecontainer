# Harness Permissions

This document contains instructions for configuring each coding harness to run with full permissions inside Docker containers.

## OpenCode

Settings file location: `.opencode/opencode.json`

Add the following properties:
```json
{
  "permission": "allow"
}
```

## OpenAI Codex

Config file location: `.codex/config.toml`

Add the following lines:
```toml
approval_policy = "never"
sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"
```

## Claude Code

Settings file location: `.claude/settings.json`

Add the following properties:
```json
{
  "permissions": {
    "allow": [
      "*",
      "Bash"
    ]
  }
}
```

## Gemini CLI

Gemini uses a "policy engine" to determine tool usage approvals. To bypass permissions, perform the following:

1. Create the policies directory if it doesn't already exist:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .gemini/policies
   ```

2. Create a rule file at `.gemini/policies/rules.toml` with the following contents:
   ```toml
   [[rule]]
   toolName = "*"
   decision = "allow"
   priority = 777
   ```
